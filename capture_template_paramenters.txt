	 %[pathname] Insert the contents of the file given by
                 ‘pathname’.  These placeholders are expanded at the very
                 beginning of the process so they can be used to extend the
                 current template.
     %(sexp)     Evaluate elisp ‘(sexp)’ and replace it with the results.
                 Only placeholders pre-existing within the template, or
                 introduced with %[pathname] are expanded this way.  Since this
                 happens after expanding non-interactive %-escapes, those can
                 be used to fill the expression.
     %<...>      The result of format-time-string on the ... format specification.
     %t          Time stamp, date only.  The time stamp is the current time,

                 with ‘org-capture-use-agenda-date’ set.
     %T          Time stamp as above, with date and time.
     %u, %U      Like the above, but inactive time stamps.
     %i          Initial content, copied from the active region.  If %i is
                 indented, the entire inserted text will be indented as well.
